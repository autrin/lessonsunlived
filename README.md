```javascript
{
    id: 5,
    title: "Your Lesson Title",
    date: "2024-01-20",
    excerpt: "Brief description of your lesson...",
    content: `
        <h2>Your Lesson Title</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">January 20, 2024 ‚Ä¢ Ethics ‚Ä¢ Your Category</p>
        
        <p>Your lesson content here...</p>
    `,
    tags: ["Ethics", "Your Category", "Your Tags"]
}
```

### Changing Colors
Modify the CSS variables in `styles.css` to customize the color scheme:

```css
:root {

## üåç About the Project

This portfolio website showcases my work as a full-stack software engineer and AI researcher, with expertise in web development, distributed systems, and ethical technology. As someone who experienced censorship in Iran and now works as a software engineer in America, I believe technologists have a moral responsibility to use their skills for good.

The dark, geeky aesthetic reflects the intersection of technology and activism, reminding us that every line of code we write either supports freedom or enables control. This project demonstrates both practical software engineering skills and specialized research interests, showing how modern web technologies, AI/ML, and decentralized systems can build a more just and compassionate world.
